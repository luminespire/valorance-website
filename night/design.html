											<h3 style="display: block; text-align: center;">DTMK Index</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">The primary focuses of Night are great statistics (extremely low SFBs and SFSs) and focused finger usage.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">Night specifies high index usage - the most dexterous finger. The most common consonant came to be <code>T</code> (akin to <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>). Of the letter pairings, <code>DTMK</code> makes use of this most effectively. <code>DTMK</code> allows for great stats while not requiring the usage of corner index keys.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">The addition of <code>D</code> and <code>M</code> makes up two other high-frequency positions. <code>K</code> takes up the third slot as a low usage letter. This keeps finger movement reasonable.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">The employment of <code>M</code> in the central column was done to reduce finger travel distance. Modifications are possible.</p>
										</div>
										<div style="flex: 1;">

										<div style="flex: 1;">
											<hr />
											<h3 style="display: block; text-align: center;">LHJ Middle</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">Traditionally, <code>R</code> is paired with <code>L</code>. <code>H</code> is, in fact, the better pairing, and thus is placed as such.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">A common column to see in this setup is <code>LHM</code>; however, this confers 2uSFSs and a good deal of movement.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">By simply omitting the <code>M</code>, these issues are resolved. <code>J</code> fills the last slot, keeping the movement low along with near <code>0%</code>SFBs.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
										<div style="flex: 1;">
											<hr />
											<h3 style="display: block; text-align: center;">FSV Ring</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">Using <code>S</code> on the pinky is one of the most common homerow setups. However, <code>SS</code> is rather frequent.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">By placing <code>S</code> on the ring instead, we avoid the pinky handling these repeats.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;"><code>F</code> and <code>V</code> both are relatively low frequency and pair almost perfectly with <code>S</code> and one another, making them well suitable for filling the remaining positions.</p>

									<h2>History | Step-by-step</h2>
									<p style="text-align: left;"><i>This section will feature the entire thought process from beginning to end of the design of Night and Nightingale. It will be one long block of text and is not important in understanding the layouts. However, if you plan on developing your own keyboard layout, you may want to consider this.</i></p>
									<hr />
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chapter 1: PBLD</h3>
									<p style="text-align: left;">The design of Night began shortly after the full release of Dusk, and I, reaching 160 WPM (MT 60s) with Stern. Stern is originally designed months before and is my follow-up to Strand (a modification by me to Oxey's Sturdy_thumbn). Although Stern is a nice layout, especially having no corner key uage, the stacks used on Stern are rather high usage. <code>DTK</code> and <code>LHM</code> on ring and middle respectively are not ideal. So, after reaching 160 WPM, I started development on Nightingale. My layout style is almost always high alternation over high roll, and the same can be said for Nightingale. However, I still wanted to maximize same row interactions. I intended to use a <code>LH_</code> middle from the start (I just personally really like it), thus finding and placing keys that commonly interacted with <code>L</code> on the same row is a priority. The ones I initially settled on were: <code>P: Place, Plan, Play, Help, B: Blow, Black, Blue, Able, etc. D: Would, World, Could, Middle, etc.</code>. Nightingale focused on placing these keys (in relation to L) on the same row to encourage a same-row finger motion - a bigram roll persay. You may notice <code>P</code> being present in the list and <code>F</code> being absent. This is because the original layout, called PBLD, used <code>PNX, BNV, LHJ, DTMK</code> stacks with <code>DTMK</code> being arranged vertically. If you know anything about layout theory, this block has some problems. First, <code>PN</code> is not a great stack. Although very optimized in SFBs, a <code>PN</code> stack suffers in SFSs. Having this on the pinky is an especially bad idea. When I first published this layout, ddn, a very well known layout creator in the AKL discord, suggested to swap the keys around to have a <code>FBLD</code> setup. This fixes the SFSs and shifts <code>P</code> to the right index. At this point, the layout featured an <code>S</code> pinky and <code>N</code> ring, along with a vertically stacked <code>DTMK</code> index. The ideal of a vertically stacked <code>DTMK</code> is purely based upon effort keymaps. <code>D</code> had to be paired close to <code>L</code>, <code>M</code> is more common than <code>K</code>, and thus <code>M</code> is relegated to the bottom index curl position and <code>K</code> into the center column middle position. Although this is a seemingly good setup, it has a hidden problem: <code>M_D</code>. This SFS, although not the most common, is still very unideal. By placing these on the top and bottom row, you create a 2U SFS that is significantly worse than a normal SFS. Thus, the easiest way to fix this, which both Night and Nightingale adopts, is placing <code>M</code> in middle column middle position. This reduces the distance between <code>D</code> and <code>M</code> significantly, and still maintains good distance relations between the other keys (<code>K_D</code> is significantly rarer by more than half). I have to admit, this idea is inspired by Dusk. You sacrifice some traditional key position comfort for movement gains - much more beneficial in this context.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chapter 2: Nightingale</h3>
									<p style="text-align: left;">Nightingale is finalized from ddn's suggestion to have an <code>FBLD</code> layout setup. Nightingale swaps the <code>FS | BN</code> stacks to create <code>BNX | FSV</code>. A small, but significant swap that further optimizes stats and comfort in usage. Next, to avoid FSBs, Nightingale swaps the <code>V</code> and <code>Z</code> keys to create a DTMKV index. You may remember from the previous section I discussed how having corner key usage is not ideal in such a high usage index. I still stand by that; However, this setup does remove all non-index FSBs as well as creating the three dead-key setup on the left hand. The stats hit from this are shown, however, if this no-full scissor setup is important to you, it may be worth the stats loss. Lastly, Nightingale uses a <code>Y</code> index as opposed to a <code>C</code> index. This setup, although just one swap, is actually more ideal compared to the <code>C</code> index Night uses. This is because <code>P_C</code> and <code>W_Y</code>, both common skipgrams, are now aligned instead of being diagonal. This leads to easier sliding (if you use that technique) and just reduces distance by a bit. To this day, I still regard Nightingale as the more interesting layout of the two. The, essentially, removal of FSBs, maximized same row usage, and still extremely low bad redirects makes it a very interesting layout to consider. I did actually use this; Check "My Review" for my thoughts - and why I switched away from it.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chapter 3: Night</h3>
									<p style="text-align: left;">Night is the final iteration of the Night layout family. There are a few others in this family that will be listed in the mods section. The reason I do not directly mention them is due to them simply not performing well compared Night itself. Speaking of which, Night is but a simple swap from Nightingale. Creation of <code>FSV</code> ring, shifting of <code>D, W</code> into the curl positions (and related), <code>C</code> index, and that is about it. Going through each one, <code>FSV</code> is done simply because it provides better stats and I preferred tanking the scissors over more skipgrams. Similarily, the <code>D, W</code> swap into the curl positions is for comfort (especially on Dactyl which I is testing at the time) and, again, I do not mind scissors. Finally, the <code>C</code> index swap, albeit a little mental, is done specifically for English-200 (Monkeytype default corpus). <code>Y</code> is very under represented in the corpus, while <code>C</code> is a little over. This leads to an awkward situation where lateral stretch usage is higher than that of homekey usage. This problem is not present on "everyday typing," but is annoying enough that I decided to move away from it (check the mods section, I used a <code>F</code> index at one point). These three changes, although small, made a big enough difference in the typing experience that I felt they deserved seperate names. Night is the current layout I am using, and what I will use until I hit 200 WPM on MT 60s. Check "My Review" for more details, but this layout is where I likely will stay. There are a few awkward sequences such as <code>people</code> and the layout not being symmetrical in terms of movement, but it is more than good to use, and that is good enough for me.</p>

									<hr />
									<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQs</h2>									
									<div class="qna">
										<p>Q: Why is <code>R</code> on the left thumb?</p>
										<p>A: <code>R</code> is placed on the left thumb due to it creating lower redirects compared to that of right thumb.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="qna">
										<p>Q: Can I use <code>R</code> on the right thumb?</p>
										<p>A: Yes, actually! Accounting for space, <code>R</code> on the right thumb is actually <i>ever slightly</i> overall superior. Thus, you can pick whichever one you prefer.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="qna">
										<p>Q: Can I use this on an Alice or split(spacebar) rowstagger keyboard?</p>
										<p style="display: none;">
											Absolutely. Due to rowstagger's corner position advantage, use these formats instead:

									<hr />
									<h2>Negatives</h2>
									<p style="text-align: left;">I would love to say there are none, but alas, like any other layout, Night has its flaws.</p>
									<p style="text-align: left;"><code>P</code> stands out as the biggest. <code>P</code> itself is not particularly common, however, a majority of its pairings involve vowels. This leads it to form a decent amount of LSBs. There are some options that you can find in Modifications, but none are perfect.</p>

									<p style="text-align: left;">The second, resolvable this time, is <code>V</code>. In quote heavy corpra, <code>L_V</code> is somewhat frequent due to <code>love</code>. This is the "only significant" scissor (it being a skipgram scissor) that occurs on Night. Luckily, if this is bothersome, simply swap <code>V</code> with <code>Q</code>, then <code>Q</code> with <code>Z</code>.</p>
